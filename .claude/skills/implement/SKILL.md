---

Implement the work described by the user in the spec or tickets.

Use /tdd where possible, at pre-agreed seams.

Run typechecking regularly, single test files regularly, and the full test suite once at the end.

Once done, use /code-review to review the work.

Commit your work to the current branch.

<!-- orc2: upstream ships this skill as user-only (`disable-model-invocation: true`).
     That flag is stripped here because a pipeline role must invoke it. -->
